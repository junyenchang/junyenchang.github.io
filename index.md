# Hello, I'm Jun-Yen Chang!

Welcome to my personal website~~

I was born in Shulin District, New Taipei City. I graduated from NYCU with a degree in Information Management and Finance and am currently pursuing my master's in Finance at NYCU. 

My favorite foods are dumplings, ramen, and curry. 

In my free time, I like watching baseball and playing volleyball, as well as sleepingâ€”because resting is the key to going further.
